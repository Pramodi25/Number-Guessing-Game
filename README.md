# Number Guessing Game

A simple console-based number guessing game implemented in Python.

## How to Play

1. Enter a lower and upper bound for the range of numbers.
2. The program will generate a random number within the specified range.
3. You have a limited number of guesses based on the range size.
4. Guess the number, and the program will provide feedback if it's too high or too low.
5. Keep guessing until you find the correct number or run out of guesses.

## Code Overview

- lower and upper: Define the lower and upper bounds for the random number generation.
- number: Randomly generated number within the specified range.
- num_guesses: Calculated based on the range size using logarithm.
- guess_count: Tracks the number of guess
